Railway Deployment PWA
This Progressive Web App (PWA) simplifies the process of deploying an n8n server to Railway. Instead of requiring users to manually install software or configure cloud services, this app guides them through a simple deployment process using an automatically generated script.

Once deployed, the app securely stores the credentials locally, allowing users to manage their n8n instance without needing to reconfigure Railway. The PWA can also transfer credentials between devices using QR codes.

How It Works
Download Deployment Script:

The app detects the user's operating system (Windows/macOS) and provides a custom deployment script.

Run the Script Locally:

The script installs the Railway CLI (if not already installed) and deploys an n8n instance on the user's Railway account.

It generates a log file containing deployment status and credentials.

Upload Log File to the PWA:

The user uploads the log file to the PWA.

If errors occur, the app provides troubleshooting steps.

If successful, Railway and n8n credentials are stored locally for future access.

Manage n8n Deployment:

The PWA allows users to access their n8n server directly.

Users can upload custom workflows or nodes for deployment.

Sync Credentials Between Devices:

Credentials can be shared securely via QR code, allowing access from another device without repeating setup.

Features
âœ… Fully Local Setup: No need for OAuthâ€”everything is done through a script and log file.
âœ… Secure Local Storage: Credentials are stored in IndexedDB, ensuring offline access.
âœ… Cross-Device Sync: Share credentials between devices via QR codes.
âœ… n8n Workflow Management: Upload and deploy workflows without using the n8n UI.
âœ… Works Offline: The PWA can be installed locally so it remains accessible even if GitHub Pages is taken down.

Future Features
ðŸ”¹ Automated Workflow Creation â€“ Generate n8n workflows from templates directly within the app.
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Project Support â€“ Manage multiple n8n deployments from a single interface.
ðŸ”¹ Enhanced Error Handling â€“ Detect common issues in the Railway log file and provide automated fixes.
