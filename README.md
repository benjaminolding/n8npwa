Railway Deployment PWA
This Progressive Web App (PWA) simplifies the process of deploying an n8n server to Railway. The app connects to your Railway account, deploys the server, and stores necessary credentials locally for easy access. It supports macOS, Windows 11, and iOS devices, making the deployment process straightforward without the need for complex setups.

Features
Connect to Railway Account: Easy OAuth integration to authenticate and retrieve your API key for Railway.

Deploy n8n Server: Automatically deploy an n8n server to Railway with minimal effort.

Store Credentials Locally: Saves Railway API key and n8n server credentials in the browserâ€™s IndexedDB for easy retrieval.

Cross-device Sync: Use a QR code to transfer credentials between devices (e.g., from a Mac to an iPhone).

Upload JSON Workflow: Upload custom workflows or nodes to your n8n server, deploying them via the app.

Easy Installation: Download and run platform-specific deployment scripts (PowerShell for Windows, Bash for macOS/Linux) to set up Railway CLI locally.

Future Features
Automatic n8n Workflow Generation: Provide an option for users to create and modify workflows directly within the app.

Multi-Project Support: Allow users to manage multiple n8n servers and projects from within the same app.
